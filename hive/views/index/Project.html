			<h2>The BeeBit Hive Project</h2>
			
			<p>The project to create the BeeBit Hive first began when Nube iO identified limitations of their HVAC automation systems, as it could not account for the effects of the heat generated by people. Wanting an IoT solution to the problem to fit with their existing product line, but without the capacity to complete it in-house, they contracted us here at BeeBit to create the solution for them. While the BeeBit Hive, during development we have identified many other ways in which the system could be used, and hope to take it much further.

			<p>Due to the complexities involved and limited initial understanding of how the system would need to work, we chose to take an Agile approach to the project, using a Scrum-Kanban hybrid methodology. The project consists of several phases of variable length, each of which will result a working version of the Hive with a subset of the required features and functionality of the final system. The tasks required to complete the features in each phase are prioritised in a Kanban board shared between our team of expert developers, and worked on in order of their priority until the phase is complete. Every component of the system is designed, refined, and built in small pieces from the bottom-up, so that we can be sure they all meet the highest quality standards.</p>

			<p>Supporting our efforts in this project are a few key software tools. Debian-based Linux operating systems are used for our main testing environment, to match the final system. Development occurs using Visual Studio Code allowing the same development environment for all programming languages used in development, alongside QEMU to allow code for the Bees to be compiled directly on development computers. Collaboration within our team operates through a GitHub repository for our code, and Google Drive for our documentation, allowing all team members access to the latest versions at all times and places.</p>

			<p>This grand undertaking is expected to be completed over February to November 2019, and we hope you all watch this space for updates over the course of the year.</p>
