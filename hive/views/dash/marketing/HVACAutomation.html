			<h2>HVAC Automation With BeeBit Hive</h2>
			
			<p>While convential HVAC automation systems can adjust the air conditioning based on environmental factors, they fail to account for one crucial factor. Every human generates a large amount of heat, and in spaces where people gather the combined effect can be substantial. The BeeBit Hive uses cutting-edge technology to determine how many people are in your building right now and shares this information with your air conditioning controller, allowing room temperature to be kept stable as people enter and leave, or even to allow operation to completely subside if no people are detected for a period of time.</p>

			<h4>Features</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Counts people within a room or area with a 95% accuracy.</li>
				<li>Operates with one Bee or multiple, to meet the needs of different building sizes and layouts.</li>
				<li>LoRa technology allows flexible deployment, Bees can be set up in any location where power is available.</li>
				<li>Built-in integration with Nube iO HVAC automation systems, or provides data output in standard formats to connect to other types of HVAC automation system.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Benefits</h4>
			
			<p>Keeping the temperature within a room level requires less effort from an air conditioning system than allowing the room to heat up and then cooling it down. Dynamic operation of the air conditioning based on the presence of people maximises both efficiency and comfort, ensuring that it always runs when people are present, and never runs when people are not. These two combined can improve the efficiency of your air conditioning system by up to 10%, potentially saving you thousands of dollars per year in energy costs.</p>
